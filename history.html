        <h2>A Journey Through Time</h2>
        <p>Vietnam has a rich and complex history that dates back thousands of years. From the time of ancient kingdoms like the Van Lang and Au Lac dynasties to the battles for independence from Chinese, French, and American forces, Vietnam has endured and thrived. One of the most significant events in the country's modern history is the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975 with the reunification of North and South Vietnam under communist rule.</p>
